# Jekyll Multiverse Template

![Multiverse by HTML5UP](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/192228387/23ca0280-91f4-11e9-86e0-afcf90e961ad)

This is a Jekyll site template based on the [Multiverse](https://html5up.net/multiverse) template by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net)

Each of the images displayed in the website is its own separate *post* -- metadata (image title and caption) goes in the [`_images`](_images) folder, and actual images (thumbnails and fulls go into [`assets/images`](assets/images)).
